A Repository for the Better Doors Minecraft Resource pack

## About

Better Doors is my personal solution for what door should be like in Minecraft. they have a more polished look with non-mirrored textures (meaning light shading is top-left to bottom-right) as they should, and have proper side textures to clarify which side the hinges are on.
