## About

**Better Doors** is my personal vision of how doors _should_ look in Minecraft. Remodeled to match the vanilla aesthetic, these doors feature non-mirrored textures—so lighting flows naturally from top-left to bottom-right—and proper side textures that clearly show which side the hinges are on, giving a more realistic and intuitive look. This pack aims to be the visual refinement that our poor Minecraft doors deserve.

## Additional Addon's

2. If you are unfamiliar with GitHub, you can upload your suggested contribution on the discord server and it'll be uploaded as an issue on your behalf.

I'll then review and filter suggestions, and if they match with the vision of the project, they'll be added into the project.
